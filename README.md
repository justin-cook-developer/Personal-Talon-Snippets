# Personal-Talon-Snippets
This repository contains all of my personal snippets for use with Talon Voice.
This repository is dependent upon the community repository(https://github.com/dwiel/talon_community), so you must clone the community repository locally as well.
The snippetCommands directory contains all of the voice commands for snippets, and the snippets created with Talon.
The snippets directory contains all of my snippets for VS Code and their respective JSON files.
